# Food Ordering App (MERN)

I used this tutorial, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4dIga_3S4I).

## Available Scripts

In the root of the project run:

### `npm install`

Also, navigate to the server folder and install modules there. You can do that by running:

### `cd server && npm install`

Afterwards, start the server from the server folder by running:

### `node index.js`
or
### `nodemon index.js`
Go back to the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
